ROS dynamixel driver package

cloned from here:
https://code.google.com/p/ua-ros-pkg/

Updated to build under ROS Groovy with the catkin build system

I'm still not sure what the right way to work with catkin is, but
this package can be checked out in the src/ directory of a catkin workspace
as decribed here:
